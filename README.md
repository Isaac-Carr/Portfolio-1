 The project is a portfolio for myself. The portfolio's main purpose is to have a platform to show my skills and accomplishments that I will acquire over time. The portfolio will have Home,About,Portfolio And contact sections. The site will be a single page. 
 
## Home Section
The home section will be a short introduction which will include my name and job title and will have contact info. The home section will have a Quote system which will fade in and out between different quotes, the code for this is from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_slideshow_auto. The rotating quotes was inspired by https://anniebombanie.com/
